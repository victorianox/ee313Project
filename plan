Planned optimizations:

Robustness

Improve read/write margins with dynamic cell voltage

Low Power

1 Resize decoder for lower power, higher delay (Andrew?)

Justification: bitline split operation completes with time to spare. Delay wordline rise to eliminate spare time, transistors smaller, save power.

2 Lower Vdd? (Reed?)

Another way to trade off delay for power. NEED to theoretically compare this to transistor resizing. Which one saves more power for the delay?

3 Move clock (Reed?)

Justification:

4 Block wordlines (Victoria)

Justification: Decrease driving capacitance, save power, makes sense
